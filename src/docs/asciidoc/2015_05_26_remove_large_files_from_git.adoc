== Problem

Say you accidentally put a large file like a jar into your git repository and published it already to github.
You could do a `git rm mylargefile` and everything is OK again. Right ? No, it isn't.
The problem is that the large file is still part of the repository's history and therefore still is part of
the repository. That means people cloning your repository still get the large file and need to download
a lot of unnecessary data.

== Example

touch readme second

git add readme
git commit -m "readme"

Generate a 100MB file:

dd if=/dev/urandom of=largefile.txt bs=1048576 count=100

git add largefile.txt
git commit -m "largefile"

git add second
git commit -m "second"

du -sh .
-> 201M .

git rm largefile.txt
git commit -m "rm largefile"

du -sh .
-> 101M .

git gc

du -sh .
-> 101M .
